# defintly
## An app to help you define concepts well.

With this easy-to-use app we want to help you define concepts well. In particular, the concept of intelligence, but it can also be used to define any other concept in any other field.

üì± **The Defintly App**

This app presents **30 quality criteria for definitions** that shall serve as guidelines for well-defined definitions. They focus on the main characteristics or properties a definition should entail in order to be considered a _good_ definition

Examples will be provided for definitions of both _machine (or artificial) and human intelligence_. However, the quality criteria could guide the process of searching for a definition in any context.

The **Defintly App** also shows how to construct a definition step by step, and is the result of both an exhaustive examination of the scientific literature on definitions and our own research on these topics.


üè∑Ô∏è **Quality Criteria and Categories**

The following mind map shows most of the quality criteria for definitions that are included in the **Defintly App**. They are grouped into five main categories and use as example the concept of intelligence. The categories are: _Completeness, Scope, Semantic, Structure,_ and _Value._

Some of the quality criteria refer to characteristics or properties that have a common origin, thus they are grouped into the same category. Other categorizations may be more convenient, however. This could depend on the concrete application or context where the concept is defined.

üß† **Defining and Understanding**

Definitions enable people to understand a concept or theory; thus, providing conceptual clarity on how definitions should be defined is, although mostly overlooked, an essential activity prior to the use of the concept or theory. If a concept is defined well, there is ground for a better understanding and further use of the concept.

How should a definition be defined? What is a _good_ definition?

Defining a concept might be a very complex problem. For example, although recent work has tried to bring clarity on defining the most important concept of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, i.e. the concept of _machine intelligence_ (Monett et al., 2020; Wang, 2019), still, there is no widespread agreed consensus on a definition of intelligence nor of AI. Furthermore, other equally important concepts that are essential for AI systems remain ill-defined (e.g. fairness, privacy, transparency). 

Is it because people don‚Äôt know how to define a definition _well_ ? Is it possible to elucidate a _good_ definition of (machine) intelligence? We have investigated these topics in detail!

If we truly want to address fundamental questions concerning the design, development, deployment, use, and even regulation of AI systems, then we need to consider definitional foundations regarding the concepts these systems deal with. We believe that the **Defintly App** can help in this endeavour. Furthermore, the **Defintly App** could allow for both better insights into intelligence, in particular, and a wider understanding of the current discourse on AI, in general.
