On Definitions
-------------------

üí° **How Should a Definition be Defined?**

To define _"is to say what a thing is"_ (Mercier, 1912). However, there is no unique way of defining a concept: definitions may be inherently contextual, and they would depend on both the people
that define them and their area of knowledge.

A definition should have the form of _"an equivalence"_ (Tarski, 1994), of _"a two-part equivalence"_ (Random, 1958), which on the one hand contains the thing to be defined, the _definiendum,_ and on the other hand the expression that defines it, the _definiens_ :

_definiendum := definiens_

Ideally, the _definiens_ follows the _definiendum_ in order of appearance and both are constructed in such a way that certain basic rules of definitions (Kelley, 2014; Tarski, 1994) are fulfilled. We widely extended the basic rules of definitions which we term **Quality Criteria for Definitions**. Both learning about and working with them constitute the fundamental purpose of the **Defintly App**!

One way of stating the meaning of the _definiendum_ is by referring to its _genus_ and _differentia_ as part of the _definiens,_ like in Aristotelian definitions:

_definiens := genus + differentia_

The _genus_ or kind is the broader category the _definiendum_ belongs to. For example, in Gottfredson‚Äôs (1997) definition of intelligence

_‚ÄúIntelligence is a very general mental capability that [. . .] involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience,‚Äù_

the words _"mental capability"_ conform the _genus_ of intelligence, i.e. they are the broader concept.

The _differentia,_ however, distinguishes the concept from other _definienda,_ in that it specifies the properties or characteristics that differentiate the _definiendum_ from other concepts from the same _genus,_ as it is expressed in the rest of the given example: animals do not comprehend complex ideas, for instance.

üõ†Ô∏è **Constructing a Definition**

We suggest to construct a definition as part of an **iterative process** consisting of the following steps:

1.   ‚úèÔ∏è Use a two-part equivalence to set the form of the definition. First, define the _definiendum_ as short and simple as possible, for example, start the definition with _‚ÄúMachine intelligence is . . . ‚Äù_ Then, define the _definiens_ with a _genus-differentia_ expression  that states the _‚Äúwhat,‚Äù_ the _‚Äúhow,‚Äù_ and the _‚Äúwhy‚Äù_ (see the list of quality criteria) of the concept that is being defined as short and simple as possible.

2.   ‚öñÔ∏è State the _differentia_ in an ostensive way (see the corresponding entry on the list of quality criteria). For example, when defining intelligence, include cognitive capabilities or functions that indicate intelligence, i.e. exemplify the _‚Äúwhat‚Äù_. Do not make the definition too ostensive nor too narrow, however.

3.   ‚úÖ Go through the list of quality criteria for definitions and evaluate whether each of them fits the _functions_ of the definition (i.e. by highlighting its essence (Aristotle, 1901; Kelley, 2014)) and in which context and extent.

4.   ‚ôªÔ∏è Add (resp. remove) content to (resp. from) the _definiens_ to meet the quality criteria. Seek for simplicity but sought for as many fulfilled quality criteria as possible. Adapt the wording and remove unnecessary expressions.

5.   üîÅ Iterate the steps 1 to 4 as long as it is needed. In particular, take a look at the language and use it _elegantly,_ thereby ensuring that the already-met quality criteria are still fulfilled, i.e. that they are not violated by occasionally changing the language.

6.   üõë Stop the process when no more improvements are necessary.
